# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using Machine Learning algorithms. It analyzes patient health records to determine the likelihood of diabetes based on key medical parameters.

## Features
- Uses ML models like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM**.
- Analyzes features like **Glucose Level, BMI, Blood Pressure, and Age**.
- Provides **accurate predictions** with performance evaluation metri

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn for Data Visualization**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- The dataset contains medical data, including features like:
  - Glucose Level
  - Blood Pressure
  - BMI
  - Age
  - Insulin Level

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Load the dataset and preprocess data.
2. Train ML models on the dataset.
3. Predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
